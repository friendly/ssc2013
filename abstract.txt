Abstract:

This talk surveys our work in the development of visualization methods 
implemented in R for understanding and interpreting the effects of 
predictors in multivariate linear models (MLMs) of the form
$$ \mat{Y} = \mat{X} \mat{B} + \mat{E}$$.

We begin with a description and examples of the HE plot framework
implemented in the \pkg{heplots}, wherein multivariate tests can be
visualized via ellipsoids for Hypothesis and Error SSP matrices
used in numerical tests.  These ideas extend naturally to repeated
measures designs in the multivariate context.

When the rank of the hypothesis matrix for a term exceeds 2,
these effects can also be visualized in a reduced-rank canonical
space via the \pkg{candisc}.

Finally, we discuss some recent work-in-progress: the extension of these
methods to robust MLMs, and the development of generalizations of
influence measures and diagnostic plots for MLMs in the
\pkg{mvinfluence}.
